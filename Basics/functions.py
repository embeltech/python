""" Since there is no main() function in Python, when the command to run a Python program is given to the interpreter, 
the code that is at level 0 indentation is to be executed. 
However, before doing that, it will define a few special variables. __name__ is one such special variable. 
If the source file is executed as the main program, the interpreter sets the __name__ variable to have a value __main__. 
If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the moduleâ€™s name.
__name__ is a built-in variable which evaluates to the name of the current module."""
